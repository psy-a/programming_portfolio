          I completed my A-Levels in 2010 and took a course in Electrical and
          Electronics Engineering<br />

          But IT has been in me since and so after graduation in 2014, I got a
          job in the IT field where I grew up the ranks to to an Asst. Product
          Manager<br />
          at Ocharge after which I decided to specialize<br />
